# Generating Pseudonyms

In this little project, we will be creating pseudonyms!

Here is a brief pseudocode overview of what the project should look like after completion:

- load a list of first names
- load a list of surnames
- choose a first name at random
- assign the name to a variable
- choose a surname at random
- assign the name to a variable
- print the names to the screen in order and in red font
- ask the user to quit or play again
- if the user plays again:
  - repeat
- if the user quits:
  - end and exit
